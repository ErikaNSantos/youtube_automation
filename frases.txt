The journey was long, but you have reached the fire.
Rest now, traveler. Your battles can wait.
Let the fire burn, and the weariness fade away.
You don't have to carry the world right now.
The silence of the night is your sanctuary.
Sit down. Breathe. Just exist for a moment.
The stars above will watch over the rest.
Your mind deserves peace as much as your body.
Let your worries turn into ashes.
Tomorrow hasn't arrived yet. You are safe now.
A well-deserved rest for those who fought with honor.
Feel the warmth. Forget the cold of the road.
The fire never dies for those seeking shelter.
You did your best today. That is enough.
The crackle of the fire is the only song that matters.
No shadows or troubles can reach you here.
Close your eyes. Restore your mana.
Put the map away. Your destination is near.
Breathe deep. The air is lighter here.
You are safe now. Rest.
